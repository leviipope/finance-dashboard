For removing a transaction manually from the view and it staying removed:

Concatonate a transaction's started date, completed date, and balace to form a unique ID.
If you have removed a t. with this unqique ID, it shouldn't show up in the DF.
The problem with this: in loadtransactions() -> we have completly removed some of these values from
tables.
Potential fix: rename the loadtransactions() function to loadTransactionsForViewing and call it only
when we want to display the information. But we need implement a loadtransactions() function for parsing
the csv for the first time.
The remove button itseelf could be implemented as a 'Remove' category.

Adding a details column to all the transactions

Remove intrest earned from Debit view
This could be easily solved by: Type = 'TOPUP' OR Description = 'Transfer from Revolut user'
The Debit view's first thing shouldnt be the df. It should be a chart.
The df is only for optionally manipulating the debits data, or for checking its integrity.
